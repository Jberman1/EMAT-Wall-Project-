# EMAT-Wall-Project-
This project was created for the Kent State EMAT program in P5.js over a semester. The idea of the project was to have a continuous looping interactive experience that would showcase students' works from the program. It was designed to be on display outside of the Kent State EMAT program office. It is designed for the user to be approximately 5 feet away from the screen and use their hand to move around it and grab/pop the bubbles shown. To pop a bubble the user must close their hand over one of the ones floating around the screen. Once a bubble is popped a quick preview video of a student's project will be shown followed by a QR code to access the student's project. Once the video is over the bubbles resume floating around the screen.

Usage Instructions in Case of Error
  Make sure to turn on hardware acceleration when viewing this project on Google.
  When the project is opened if the screen is white refresh and the issue should be fixed.
  The project has many video assets which need to load so be patient when opening it for the first time. (Should only take 5-10 seconds to load)
