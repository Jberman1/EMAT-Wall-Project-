# EMAT-Wall-Project-
This project was created for the Kent State EMAT program in P5.js.
This project is an interactive experience for the user to showcase student work from the program.
The user will use their hand to hover over one of the bubbles and then close their hand to pop it starting a video preview of one of the few projects included.
